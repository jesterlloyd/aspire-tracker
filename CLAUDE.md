# CLAUDE.md (aspire-tracker)

Project rules for ASPIRE Intelligence. This extends the folder-level `Claude/CLAUDE.md`
and the workspace `05_AI/CLAUDE.md`; read those first. Everything below is specific to
this repository and applies to every session working in it, including parallel ones.

## Visual canon (UI-CONSISTENCY-1, 2026-09-03)

Every surface, staff app and every portal alike, resolves to one set of values, and
those values live in **one file**: `src/styles/aspireBrand.css`. Both halves of the app
import it. Do not restate a value in a component; read the token.

| What | Token | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Card corner | `--aspire-radius-card` | 12px |
| Control corner (buttons, inputs) | `--aspire-radius-control` | 10px |
| Space between sibling cards | `--aspire-gap-card` | 16px |
| Section nav to first card | `--aspire-page-top` | 24px |
| Table header size | `--aspire-th-size` | 11px, uppercase |
| Card edge | `--aspire-shadow-card` | the shadow IS the edge; cards have `border: 0` |
| Secondary nav hairline | `--aspire-nav-line` | shared by `.chart-nav` and `.ptl-nav` |

Rules that follow from the table:

1. **A card is one of three classes.** Staff: `.snap` (full-width section card) or
   `.ov-panel` (a panel inside a grid). Portal: `.ptl-card`. Do not write a new card rule;
   put the content inside one of these. If a genuinely new card class is unavoidable, it
   reads the four tokens above and has no border.
2. **Followers carry the top margin, cards never carry a bottom one.** A `.snap` has
   `margin: var(--aspire-gap-card) 20px 0`. Anything that comes after a card (`.ov-panels`,
   `.dashboard`, another card) supplies its own `margin-top: var(--aspire-gap-card)`.
   Vertical margins do not collapse in a flex column, so a bottom margin plus a top margin
   makes 32px, and a missing top margin makes 0px. Both have shipped; neither should again.
3. **No literal radii, gaps, or header sizes.** `border-radius: 8px` in CSS or
   `borderRadius: 8` in JSX is a canon violation unless it is a pill (`999px`), a circle
   (`50%`), or a chip inside a card. `test/uiCanonRatchet.test.mjs` counts literal radii
   across `src/` and fails if the count goes UP. Lower it when you can; never raise it.
4. **The navy `.tab-bar` is app-level brand chrome and stays navy.** Section navs
   (`.chart-nav`, `.ngrp` nav, `.ptl-nav`) are light with the shared hairline.
5. **Titles are Title Case; sentences are not.** Section, panel, card, chart and drawer
   titles: "Benefit Contribution by School", "Cohort Timeline". Empty states, prompts,
   toasts, aria-labels that read as sentences, and email prose stay sentence case:
   "No students match this filter", "Portal access granted."
6. **Measure, never compute.** Before claiming a spacing or radius is fixed, render the
   real stylesheets against the real sibling order and read `getComputedStyle` and
   `getBoundingClientRect`. Source reading missed two cascade overrides on the day this
   canon shipped; a browser caught both.

## Tables (UI-CONSISTENCY-3)

One header for every table, defined once in `src/styles/aspireTable.css`, which both
`index.css` and `PortalApp.jsx` import. A header cell is `<th className="aspire-th">`
(`aspire-th-right` / `aspire-th-center` for alignment). Do not write an inline `<th style>`
or a per-table header class; the ratchet counts inline header styles and fails if the
count rises.

A sortable column is `<SortHeader>` from `src/components/shared/SortHeader.jsx`. Its rule
is that the arrow appears only on the sorted column (up or down) and there is never a
resting glyph. The `<button>` it renders inherits the cell's caps, tracking and size from
the shared sheet; do not give it inline `font` or `color`. That inline `font: inherit`,
and the browser's own button defaults, are how sortable columns came to render in a
different case and size from their neighbours in three tables at once.

## New portal checklist

A new portal imports `src/styles/aspireBrand.css` (as `PortalApp.jsx` does), uses
`.ptl-card` for its cards, `.ptl-nav` for its section nav, and `.ptl-main` for its page
column so the first card lands at `--aspire-page-top`. Its tables use `.ptl-table`. If it
needs a component the other portals do not have, build it from the tokens, not from numbers.

## Student names

Display a student by `getStudentPreferredFullName` or `displayName` from
`src/lib/studentNameFormatters.js` / `src/lib/utils.js`. Never compose
`first_name + last_name` at a call site, and every `students` select that reads a name
also reads `preferred_first_name`. `test/studentPreferredNameSurfaces.test.mjs` enforces
both.

## Working in this repository

- Another session commits to `main` concurrently in the **same working tree**. Verify the
  baseline yourself, stage files **by name**, and for changes touching many files work in
  a `git worktree` off `origin/main` so their uncommitted work is never disturbed.
- Never apply SQL. Migrations are Owner-gated through `docs/security/OWNER_SQL_GATE.md`;
  verification queries go in `db/audit/`, numbered, one section at a time.
- Do not push without explicit approval.
- Leave the untracked `" 2."` / `" 3."` duplicate files alone.
